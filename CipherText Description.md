# CipherText
Small Text Encryption Class Project

A small text encryption application written for a computer systems security elective class. The assignment was just to write a simple Caesar cipher and Feistel cipher command line app but I took it a step further and used some skills I learned in my GUI class to make a nice UI for the application as well. It's functional to encrypt and decrypt text and even has a brute force option to decrypt any text you put thatâ€™s been encrypted with Caesar cipher encryption. I received a grade of 110% on the project with 10% extra credit for the design and ended up with more than 100% overall in the class.
